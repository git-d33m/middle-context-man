# The Middle Context Man

> The invisible infrastructure that makes AI conversations actually work

## 🎯 What This Solves
- **Context Loss**: Stop re-explaining yourself to AI every session
- **Platform Switching**: Seamless handoff between Claude, ChatGPT, etc.
- **Session Breaks**: Pick up conversations exactly where you left off
- **Memory Fragmentation**: AI feels like working with one persistent collaborator

## 🔧 Current Status
- ✅ Working browser extension prototype
- ✅ Multi-profile context injection
- ✅ Platform detection (Claude, ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Perplexity)
- ✅ #Tag command system (#business, #technical, #new, #carry)
- 🔄 Cross-session persistence (in development)
- 🔄 Context compression algorithms (planned)

## 🏗️ Repository Structure
```
browser-extension/    # Extension code and prototypes
documentation/        # Session summaries and insights
research/            # User feedback and market analysis
prototypes/          # Experimental features
business/            # Strategy, roadmap, funding docs
archive/             # Historical decisions and learnings
```

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. Load browser-extension/ in Chrome/Firefox developer mode
2. Visit any AI platform
3. Extension auto-injects your context profile
4. Experience seamless AI conversations

## 💡 The Vision
Making AI interactions feel as natural as talking to a colleague who remembers everything from your previous conversations.

**Status**: Organizing development chaos into structured progress
**Next**: Session persistence and cross-device sync
